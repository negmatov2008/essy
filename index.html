            attitudes of the people and there is lower that can be done to
            rectify this. That is partly true but everyone has their idea of

            >Nowadays many people like to watch and spend more time on YouTube,
            Instagram, Facebook, and other media. Firstly that is because many
            people spend on social media marketing and watch some videos. So
            that have any effect on their idea or opinions? Secondly, all
            humanity can not imagine their own life no media. So the media very
            important to our lives because we are talking online with our
            friends, parents, and others, we write messages to our boss or
            teacher, and we are read new information such as BBS. For example,
            my best friend likes to watch Instagram reels and he every day
            enters his own Instagram account. So then he put some photos and
            videos on his Instagram account then he earned money from the
            media.</span

          <span class="body2"
            >However, everybody has their idea and opinions about their life, so
            someone canâ€™t control them.Firstly if somebody controls the media,
            that is not dangerous to our lives and ideas or opinions because the
            media is really big information in the modern era, so that is
            impossible for someone to control the media. Secondly, everyone has
            an interesting thing and they watch some videos about their interest
            in media. That does not give more effect to their opinion. They do
            not enter the background of the internet because it has more damage
            to your life even if it can kill you.</span

            >In my opinion, many people spend on social media marketing, all
            people can imagine their lives on the internet. Control the media,
            is an impossible situation, everyone has interesting topics and
            watches the videos.</span
